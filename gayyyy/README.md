Just some basic messing around with python and python tutorials and python challenges.

must have ran
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install html5lib
pip install dateutil

run using python 3 on gayBarScrape.py

front end is in folder front:
  npm install -g gulp
  npm install

  then use gulp to develop
  http-server is a package that makes a pretty easy way to test.


set up fbkeys.py by removing the template suffix from fbkeys.py.template and setting some of the constants.
