Just some basic messing around with python and python tutorials and python challenges.

must have ran
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install html5lib

#install latest facebook-sdk because release doesn't support python 3
pip install -e git+https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk.git#egg=facebook-sdk

run using python 3 on gayBarScrape.py

front end is in folder front:
  npm install -g gulp
  npm install

  then use gulp to develop
  http-server is a package that makes a pretty easy way to test.
