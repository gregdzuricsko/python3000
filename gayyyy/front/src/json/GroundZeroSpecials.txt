Now an underground veteran, his storied experience fuels his energetic mixing style and shapes his musical knowledge and deep track collection. Aaron is known for blending classic tracks with new and unreleased cuts. His layered blend of techno, house and acid has taken him across America: from Chicago to Portland, San Diego to Detroit. Behind the decks, his enthusiasm is infectious. Aaron mixes with an intensity that is not only heard but felt, resulting in unforgettable crowd experiences\n\nJesse Jakob \n(Traut Muzik, Stockholm LTD, Mindtrip )\n\nWhile Jesse Jakob is a relative newcomer to the global techno scene, he has quietly been building a resume that goes back over two decades. A longtime fixture in the Minneapolis techno community, he has been DJ'ing since the mid 1990's and his many years of experience have honed his ear to a special strain of music. His sets and productions are reflective of his taste for raw, powerful, stripped down grooves and a control gained only through countless hours of dedication\n\nEverest\n(Re:Load Minneapolis / Grindhou5e Audio / Darktide Recordings / Abducted Records / Celsius Recordings / Suspect Device / Connected Audio / Liquid Brilliants / TCDNB /  IN:DEEP Music)\n\nSince changing his name from Pisky to Everest and coming over to the dark side of electronic music, Mike has been making huge nasty sounds and big waves in the Jungle:Drum & Bass scene on a National and soon to be International level. With the freshest drum rhythms and nastiest sound design in his production, Everest is definitely not an artist that will go un noticed in the years to come.\n\nNick Twist\n(Re:load Minneapolis)\n\nWith a careful Ear, Technical skills and an ever growing music library of the Hottest Bangers and Coolest Melodies in the underground world you can Expect Dj Nick Twist to be on top of the Vibe. The only goal in his career is to keep the dance floor moving side to side. Whether in a high class club environment or the dirtiest of all night outlaw parties. Expect V.I.P mixes and Vinyl Only pressings. Expect Huge tracks and minimal melodies. Expect big things from the one they call Nick Twist.\n\n\n-Hosted by MC Hyde-\n\nRachel Palmer - Live Visuals\n[SYSTEM]\n\n\n18+\n$10 entry\n2 - for - 1 drinks from 10pm-11pm\n1love", "parsed_start_time": "22:00:00", "name": "Re:Load Minneapolis |Re:Load with SYSTEM| Everest, Aaron Litschke, Jesse Jakob, Nick Twist, MC HYDE"}, "Fri, 07, August": {"id": "1465005033798540", "place": {"location": {"street": "15 NE 4th St", "country": "United States", "longitude": -93.255171101099, "latitude": 44.98905136893, "city": "Minneapolis", "zip": "55413-2219", "state": "MN"}, "name": "Ground Zero Nightclub", "id": "162965219745"}, "start_time": "2015-08-07T22:00:00-0500", "description": "After a whirlwind July hiatus we are BACK and we have cooked up a SPECTACULAR show for you!  \n\nThis month will feature special guests:\n\nThe birthday girl Nadi A'marena\n\nNudie Newbie Champion Deeva Rose\n\nAcrobatic feats by Toil & Tumble\n\nAs well as our Hot Dish cast:\n\nUppen Adam\nPepper Sunshine\nLuna Rouge\nMona Montague\nOpiumm Hayze\nHolliedazzle\nBret the Axe\nBillie Marquee\n\n\nOnly $8 Cover!\n2 for 1 drinks until 11!\n\nGround Zero Nightclub\n15 4th St NE Minneapolis MN 55413\n\nVIP Seating only an additional $5! \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BL-bUDjqHU9vgEDB-U7PndkBZyqO7yBPTJi6uvH0saQ/viewform?usp=send_form", "parsed_start_time": "22:00:00", "name": "Hot Dish Cabaret's August Show"}, "Fri, 28, August": {"name": "HDMN pres.
